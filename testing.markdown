Testing Sinatra with Rack::Test
===============================

**NOTE: Sinatra's built-in test framework has been deprecated in favor of
[Rack::Test](http://gitrdoc.com/brynary/rack-test/tree/master) as of version
0.9.2. This document describes testing with Rack::Test.**

All examples in the following  sections assume that `Test::Unit` is being 
used in an attempt to be as general as possible. See the [Test Framework
Examples](#frameworks) for information on using the test helpers in
other testing environments.

Example App: `hello_world.rb`
-----------------------------

The following example app is used to illustrate testing features. This is
assumed to be in a file named `hello_world.rb`:

    require 'sinatra'

    get '/' do
      "Hello World #{params[:name]}".strip
    end

Using The `Rack::Test::Methods` Mixin
-------------------------------------

The `Rack::Test::Methods` module includes a variety of helper methods for
simulating requests against an application and asserting expectations about
the response. It's typically included directly within the test context and
makes a few helper methods and attributes available.

The following is a simple example that ensures the hello world app functions
properly:

    require 'hello_world'
    require 'test/unit'
    require 'rack/test'

    set :environment, :test

    class HelloWorldTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      include Rack::Test::Methods

      def app
        Sinatra::Application
      end

      def test_it_says_hello_world
        get '/'
        assert last_response.ok?
        assert_equal 'Hello World', last_response.body
      end

      def test_it_says_hello_to_a_person
        get '/', :name => 'Simon'
        assert last_response.body.include?('Simon')
      end
    end

Using `Rack::Test` without the Mixin
------------------------------------
For a variety of reasons you may not want to include `Rack::Test::Methods`
into your own classes.  `Rack::Test` supports this style of testing as well, here is the above example without using Mixin.


    require 'hello_world'
    require 'test/unit'
    require 'rack/test'

    set :environment, :test

    class HelloWorldTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

      def test_it_says_hello_world
	    browser = Rack::Test::Session.new(Sinatra::Application)
        browser.get '/'
        assert browser.last_response.ok?
        assert_equal 'Hello World', browser.last_response.body
      end

      def test_it_says_hello_to_a_person
	    browser = Rack::Test::Session.new(Sinatra::Application)
        browser.get '/', :name => 'Simon'
        assert browser.last_response.body.include?('Simon')
      end
    end


### Rack::Test's Mock Request Methods

The `get`, `put`, `post`, `delete`, and `head` methods simulate the
respective type of request on the application. Tests typically begin with
a call to one of these methods followed by one or more assertions against
the resulting response.

All mock request methods have the same argument signature:

    get '/path', params={}, rack_env={}

 * `/path` is the request path and may optionally include a query string.

 * `params` is a Hash of query/post parameters, a String request body, or
   `nil`.

 * `rack_env` is a Hash of Rack environment values. This can be used to
   set request headers and other request related information, such as session
   data. See the [Rack SPEC][spec] for more information on possible key/values.

### Asserting Expectations About The Response

Once a request method has been invoked, the following attributes are
available for making assertions:

 * `app` - The Sinatra application class that handled the mock request.

 * `last_request` - The [`Rack::MockRequest`][Rack::MockRequest] used to generate
   the request.

 * `last_response` - A [`Rack::MockResponse`][Rack::MockResponse] instance with
   information on the response generated by the application.

Assertions are typically made against the `last_response` object.
Consider the following examples:

    def test_it_says_hello_world
      get '/'
      assert last_response.ok?
      assert_equal 'Hello World'.length.to_s, last_response.header['Content-Length']
      assert_equal 'Hello World', last_response.body
    end

### Optional Test Setup

The `Rack::Test` mock request methods send requests to the return value of
a method named `app`.

If you're testing a modular application that has multiple `Sinatra::Base`
subclasses, simply set the `app` method to return your particular class.

      def app 
        MySinatraApp
      end

If you're using a classic style Sinatra application, then you need to return an 
instance of `Sinatra::Application`.

      def app
        Sinatra::Application
      end

### Making `Rack::Test` available to all test cases

If you'd like the `Rack::Test` methods to be available to all test cases
without having to include it each time, you can include the `Rack::Test`
module in the `Test::Unit::TestCase` class:

    require 'test/unit'
    require 'rack/test'

    class Test::Unit::TestCase
      include Rack::Test::Methods
    end

Now all `TestCase` subclasses will automatically have `Rack::Test`
available to them.

Test Framework Examples {#frameworks}
-----------------------

As of version `0.9.1`, Sinatra no longer provides testing framework-specific
helpers. Those found in `sinatra/test/*.rb` are deprecated and will be
removed in Sinatra `1.0`.

### [RSpec][]

Sinatra can be tested under RSpec using the `spec/interop` library. The
`Rack::Test` module should be included within the `describe` block:

    require 'hello_world'  # <-- your sinatra app
    require 'spec'
    require 'spec/interop/test'
    require 'rack/test'

    set :environment, :test

    describe 'The HelloWorld App' do
      include Rack::Test::Methods

      it "says hello" do
        get '/'
        last_response.should be_ok
        last_response.body.should == 'Hello World'
      end
    end

Make `Rack::Test` available to all spec contexts by including it in
`Test::Unit::TestCase`:

    require 'spec'
    require 'spec/interop/test'
    require 'rack/test'

    Test::Unit::TestCase.send :include, Rack::Test::Methods

### [Bacon][]

Testing with Bacon is similar to `test/unit` and RSpec:

    require 'hello_world'  # <-- your sinatra app
    require 'bacon'
    require 'rack/test'

    set :environment, :test

    describe 'The HelloWorld App' do
      include Rack::Test::Methods

      it "says hello" do
        get '/'
        last_response.should.be.ok
        last_response.body.should.equal 'Hello World'
      end
    end

Make `Rack::Test` available to all spec contexts by including it in
`Bacon::Context`:

    class Bacon::Context
      include Rack::Test::Methods
    end

### [Test::Spec][]

The `Rack::Test` module should be included within the context of the
`describe` block:

    require 'hello_world'  # <-- your sinatra app
    require 'test/spec'
    require 'rack/test'

    set :environment, :test

    describe 'The HelloWorld App' do
      include Rack::Test::Methods

      it "says hello" do
        get '/'
        last_response.should.be.ok
        last_response.body.should.equal 'Hello World'
      end
    end

Make `Rack::Test` available to all spec contexts by including it in
`Test::Unit::TestCase`:

    require 'test/spec'
    require 'rack/test'

    Test::Unit::TestCase.send :include, Rack::Test::Methods
