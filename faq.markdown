What happened to reloading in Sinatra 0.9.2? {#reloading}
--------------------------------------------

Source file reloading was removed in the 0.9.2 due to excess complexity.

For reloading Sinatra we recommend either using the
[reloader](/contrib/reloader) or
[shotgun](http://rtomayko.github.com/shotgun/).

The reloader will reload single files that changed, whereas shotgun will
restart the HTTP server on every request. See ["Reloading Ruby
Code"](http://rkh.im/code-reloading) to learn more about the differences.

What are my deployment options? {#deploy}
-------------------------------

See the [book](book.html#deployment).

How do I use sessions? {#sessions}
----------------------

Sessions are disabled by default. You need to enable them and then use the
`session` hash from routes and views:

    enable :sessions

    get '/foo' do
      session[:message] = 'Hello World!'
      redirect '/bar'
    end

    get '/bar' do
      session[:message]   # => 'Hello World!'
    end

If you need to set additional parameters for sessions, like expiration date, use [`Rack::Session::Cookie`](http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/classes/Rack/Session/Cookie.html) directly instead of `enable :sessions` (example from _Rack_ documentation):

    use Rack::Session::Cookie, :key => 'rack.session',
                               :domain => 'foo.com',
                               :path => '/',
                               :expire_after => 2592000, # In seconds
                               :secret => 'change_me'

How do I use session-based flash? {#flash}
--------------------------------

Use [Rack::Flash](http://github.com/nakajima/rack-flash).

Can I run Sinatra under Ruby 1.9? {#ruby19}
---------------------------------

Yes. As of Sinatra 0.9.2, Sinatra is fully Ruby 1.9 and Rack 1.0 compatible.
Since 1.1 you do not have to deal with encodings on your own, unless you want to.

How do I get the "route" for the current page? {#path_info}
----------------------------------------------

The `request` object probably has what you're looking for:

    get '/hello-world' do
      request.path_info   # => '/hello-world'
      request.fullpath    # => '/hello-world?foo=bar'
      request.url         # => 'http://example.com/hello-world?foo=bar'
    end

See [Rack::Request](http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/classes/Rack/Request.html)
for a detailed list of methods supported by the `request` object.

How do I access helpers from within my views? {#helpview}
---------------------------------------------

Call them! Views automatically have access to all helper methods. In fact,
Sinatra evaluates routes, views, and helpers within the same exact object
context so they all have access to the same methods and instance variables.

In `hello.rb`:

    helpers do
      def em(text)
        "<em>#{text}</em>"
      end
    end

    get '/hello' do
      @subject = 'World'
      haml :hello
    end

In `views/hello.haml`:

    %p= "Hello " + em(@subject)

How do I render partials? {#partials}
-------------------------

Sinatra's template system is simple enough that it can be used for page and
fragment level rendering tasks. The `erb` and `haml` methods simply return a
string.

Since Sinatra 1.1, you can use the same calls for partials you use in the routes:

    <%= erb :mypartial %>

In versions prior to 1.1, you need to make sure you disable layout rendering as
follows:

    <%= erb :mypartial, :layout => false %>

See [Sam Elliott](http://www.lenary.co.uk/)'s
[partials.rb](http://gist.github.com/119874)
for a more robust partials implementation. It even supports rendering
collections and partials in subdirectories. It was adapted from [Chris Schneider](http://www.gittr.com/)'s
[partials.rb](http://github.com/cschneid/irclogger/blob/master/lib/partials.rb) implementation to remove dependency on `#extract_options!` and add subdirectory support. 

Use it as follows to render the `_mypartial.erb`(1) or the `admin/_mypartial.erb`(2) partials, or with a collection (3) & (4):

    <%= partial(:mypartial) %> <!--(1)-->
    <%= partial(:'admin/mypartial') %> <!--(2)-->
    <%= partial(:object, :collection => @objects) %> <!--(3)-->
    <%= partial(:'admin/object', :collection => @objects) %> <!--(4)-->

In (1) & (2), the partial will be rendered plain from their files, with no local variables (specify them with a hash passed into `:locals`). In (3) & (4), the partials will be rendered, populating the local variable `object` with each of the objects from the collection. 


Can I have multiple URLs trigger the same route/handler? {#multiroute}
--------------------------------------------------------

Sure:

    ["/foo", "/bar", "/baz"].each do |path|
      get path do
        "You've reached me at #{request.path_info}"
      end
    end

Seriously.

How do I make the trailing slash optional? {#slash}
------------------------------------------

Put a question mark after it:

    get '/foo/bar/?' do
      "Hello World"
    end

The route matches `"/foo/bar"` and `"/foo/bar/"`.

How do I render templates nested in subdirectories? {#subdir}
---------------------------------------------------

Sinatra apps do not typically have a very complex file hierarchy under
`views`. First, consider whether you really need subdirectories at all.
If so, you can use the `views/foo/bar.haml` file as a template with:

    get '/' do
      haml :'foo/bar'
    end

This is basically the same as sending `#to_sym` to the filename and can also
be written as:

    get '/' do
      haml 'foo/bar'.to_sym
    end

I'm running Thin and an error occurs but there's no output {#thindebug}
----------------------------------------------------------

Try starting Thin with the `--debug` argument:

    thin --debug --rackup config.ru start

That should give you an exception and backtrace on `stderr`.

How do I send Email from Sinatra? {#email}
---------------------------------

How about a [Pony](http://adam.heroku.com/past/2008/11/2/pony_the_express_way_to_send_email_from_ruby/)
(`sudo gem install pony`):

    require 'pony'
    post '/signup' do
      Pony.mail :to => 'you@example.com',
                :from => 'me@example.com',
                :subject => 'Howdy, Partna!'
    end

You can even use templates to render the body. In `email.erb`:

    Good day <%= params[:name] %>,

    Thanks for my signing my guestbook. You're a doll.

    Frank

And in `mailerapp.rb`:

    post '/guestbook/sign' do
      Pony.mail :to => params[:email],
                :from => "me@example.com",
                :subject => "Thanks for signing my guestbook, #{params[:name]}!",
                :body => erb(:email)
    end

How do I escape html? {#escape_html}
---------------------

Include [Rack::Utils](http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/classes/Rack/Utils.html)
in your helpers and create an `h` alias as follows:

    helpers do
      include Rack::Utils
      alias_method :h :escape_html
    end

Now you can escape html in your templates like this:

    <%= h scary_output %>

Thanks to [Chris Schneider](http://www.gittr.com/index.php/archive/using-rackutils-in-sinatra-escape_html-h-in-rails/)
for the tip!

How do I automatically escape html? {#auto_escape_html}
---------------------

Require [Erubis](http://rubygems.org/gems/erubis) and set `escape_html` to `true`:

    require 'erubis'
    set :erubis, :escape_html => true

Then, any templates rendered with Erubis will be automatically escaped:

    get '/' do
      erubis :index
    end

How do I use ActiveRecord migrations? {#ar-migrations}
-------------------------------------

From [Adam Wiggins's blog](http://adam.blog.heroku.com/past/2009/2/28/activerecord_migrations_outside_rails/):

> To use ActiveRecord’s migrations with Sinatra (or other non-Rails project),
> add the following to your Rakefile:
>
>     namespace :db do
>       desc "Migrate the database"
>       task(:migrate => :environment) do
>         ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
>         ActiveRecord::Migration.verbose = true
>         ActiveRecord::Migrator.migrate("db/migrate")
>       end
>     end
>
> This assumes you have a task called `:environment` which loads your app’s
> environment (requires the right files, sets up the database connection, etc).
>
> Now you can create a directory called `db/migrate` and fill in your
> migrations. I usually call the first one `001_init.rb`.
> (I prefer the old sequential method for numbering migrations vs. the
> datetime method used since Rails 2.1, but either will work.)


How do I use HTTP authentication? {#auth}
---------------------------------

You have at least two options for implementing basic access authentication (Basic HTTP Auth) in your application.

I. When you want to protect all requests in the application, simply put Rack::Auth::Basic middleware in the request processing chain by the `use` directive:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sinatra'

    use Rack::Auth::Basic, "Restricted Area" do |username, password|
      [username, password] == ['admin', 'admin']
    end

    get '/' do
      "You're welcome"
    end

    get '/foo' do
      "You're also welcome"
    end

II. When you want to protect only certain URLs in the application, or want the authorization to be more complex, you may use something like this:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sinatra'

    helpers do

      def protected!
        unless authorized?
          response['WWW-Authenticate'] = %(Basic realm="Restricted Area")
          throw(:halt, [401, "Not authorized\n"])
        end
      end

      def authorized?
        @auth ||=  Rack::Auth::Basic::Request.new(request.env)
        @auth.provided? && @auth.basic? && @auth.credentials && @auth.credentials == ['admin', 'admin']
      end

    end

    get '/' do
      "Everybody can see this page"
    end

    get '/protected' do
      protected!
      "Welcome, authenticated client"
    end


How do I test HTTP authentication? {#test_http_auth}
----------------------------------

Assuming you have this simple implementation of HTTP authentication in your `application.rb`:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sinatra'

    use Rack::Auth::Basic do |username, password|
      [username, password] == ['admin', 'admin']
    end

    get '/protected' do
      "You're welcome"
    end

You can test it like this with [_Rack::Test_](https://github.com/brynary/rack-test):

    ENV['RACK_ENV'] = 'test'

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'test/unit'
    require 'rack/test'

    require 'application'

    class ApplicationTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      include Rack::Test::Methods

      def app
        Sinatra::Application
      end

      def test_without_authentication
        get '/protected'
        assert_equal 401, last_response.status
      end

      def test_with_bad_credentials
        authorize 'bad', 'boy'
        get '/protected'
        assert_equal 401, last_response.status
      end

      def test_with_proper_credentials
        authorize 'admin', 'admin'
        get '/protected'
        assert_equal 200, last_response.status
        assert_equal "You're welcome", last_response.body
      end
    end
