<h1>Sinatra::ContentFor</h1>

<p><tt>Sinatra::ContentFor</tt> is a set of helpers that allows you to capture
blocks inside views to be rendered later during the request. The most
common use is to populate different parts of your layout from your view.</p>

<p>The currently supported engines are: Erb, Erubis, Haml and Slim.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>You call <tt>content_for</tt>, generally from a view, to capture a block of
markup giving it an identifier:</p>

<pre># index.erb
&lt;% content_for :some_key do %&gt;
  &lt;chunk of=&quot;html&quot;&gt;...&lt;/chunk&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>

<p>Then, you call <tt>yield_content</tt> with that identifier, generally from
a layout, to render the captured block:</p>

<pre># layout.erb
&lt;%= yield_content :some_key %&gt;</pre>

<h3>Classic Application</h3>

<p>To use the helpers in a classic application all you need to do is require
them:</p>

<pre>require &quot;sinatra&quot;
require &quot;sinatra/content_for&quot;

# Your classic application code goes here...</pre>

<h3>Modular Application</h3>

<p>To use the helpers in a modular application you need to require them, and
then, tell the application you will use them:</p>

<pre>require &quot;sinatra/base&quot;
require &quot;sinatra/content_for&quot;

class MyApp &lt; Sinatra::Base
  helpers Sinatra::ContentFor

  # The rest of your modular application code goes here...
end</pre>

<h2>And How Is This Useful?</h2>

<p>For example, some of your views might need a few javascript tags and
stylesheets, but you donâ€™t want to force this files in all your pages. Then
you can put <tt>&lt;% yield_content :scripts_and_styles %&gt;</tt> on your
layout, inside the &lt;head&gt; tag, and each view can call
<tt>content_for</tt> setting the appropriate set of tags that should be
added to the layout.</p>
