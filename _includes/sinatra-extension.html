<h1>Sinatra::Extension</h1>

<p><tt>Sinatra::Extension</tt> is a mixin that provides some syntactic sugar
for your extensions. It allows you to call almost any
<tt>Sinatra::Base</tt> method directly inside your extension module. This
means you can use <tt>get</tt> to define a route, <tt>before</tt> to define
a before filter, <tt>set</tt> to define a setting and so on.</p>

<p>Is important to be aware that this mixin remembers the method calls you
make, and then, when your extension is registered, replays them on the
Sinatra application that has been extended.  In order to do that, it
defines a <tt>registered</tt> method, so, if your extension defines one
too, remember to call <tt>super</tt>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Just require the mixin and extend your extension with it:</p>

<pre>require 'sinatra/extension'

module MyExtension
  extend Sinatra::Extension

  # set some settings for development
  configure :development do
    set :reload_stuff, true
  end

  # define a route
  get '/' do
    'Hello World'
  end

  # The rest of your extension code goes here...
end</pre>

<p>You can also create an extension with the <tt>new</tt> method:</p>

<pre>MyExtension = Sinatra::Extension.new do
  # Your extension code goes here...
end</pre>

<p>This is useful when you just want to pass a block to
<tt>Sinatra::Base.register</tt>.</p>
