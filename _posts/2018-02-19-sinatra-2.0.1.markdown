I have just released Sinatra v2.0.1 and Mustermann v1.0.2.

Before we begin, I want to thank everyone who contributed, helped test pre-releases, and continues to use and support the project.

## Security Fix

The rack-protection-v2.0.1 contains a security fix about [CVE-2018-7212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7212).

We would highly recommend to upgrade your rack-protection.

If you're on older sinatra versions, please use [v1.5.4](https://rubygems.org/gems/rack-protection/versions/1.5.4) which backported the security fix.

## Releases

Sinatra v2.0.1 includes the release of the following gems, and associated versions:

* `sinatra`: v2.0.1
* `sinatra-contrib`: v2.0.1
* `rack-protection`: v2.0.1
* `mustermann`: v1.0.2
* `mustermann-contrib`: v1.0.2
