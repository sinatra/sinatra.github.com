Just getting started with Sinatra and wondering how to do something that should
be obvious? [Check out The FAQ](/faq.html). We culled a few weeks worth of IRC
logs and mailing list threads to compile the initial set of entries and
we'll be adding to the list considerably over the coming weeks.

Have an idea for a FAQ entry? Fork the
[sinatra.github.com repository](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra.github.com),
add the entry to `faq.markdown`, and push. We'll take care of the rest.
