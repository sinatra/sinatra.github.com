Writing Extensions
==================

Sinatra includes an API for extension authors to help ensure that
consistent behavior is provided for application developers.

Background
----------

Some knowledge of Sinatra's internal design is required to write good
extensions. This section provides a high level overview of the classes
and idioms at the core of Sinatra's design.

Sinatra has two distinct modes of use that extensions should be aware of:

 1. The "Classic" style, where applications are defined on main / the
    top-level -- most of the examples and documentation target this usage.
    Classic applications are often single-file, standalone apps that are run
    directly from the command line or with a minimal rackup file. When an
    extension is required in a classic application, the expectation is that
    all extension functionality should be present without additional setup
    on the application developers part (like included/extending modules).

 2. The "Modular" style, where `Sinatra::Base` is subclassed explicitly and
    the application is defined within the subclass's scope. These
    applications are often bundled as libraries and used as components
    within a larger Rack-based system. Modular applications must include
    any desired extensions explicitly by calling `register ExtensionModule`
    within the application's class scope.

Most extensions are relevant to both styles but care must be taken by
extension authors to ensure that extensions do the right thing under each
style. The extension API (`Sinatra.register` and `Sinatra.helpers`) is
provided to help extension authors with this task.

__Important:__ The following notes on `Sinatra::Base` and
`Sinatra::Application` are provided for background only - extension
authors should not need to modify these classes directly.

### `Sinatra::Base`

The `Sinatra::Base` class provides the context for all evaluation in a
Sinatra application. The top-level DSLish stuff exists in class scope
while request-level stuff exists at instance scope.

Applications are _defined_ within the class scope of a `Sinatra::Base`
subclass. The "DSL" (e.g., `get`, `post`, `before`, `configure`, `set`,
etc.) is simply a set of class methods defined on `Sinatra::Base`. Extending
the DSL is achieved by adding class methods to `Sinatra::Base` or one of its
subclasses. However, Base classes should not be extended with
`extend`; the `Sinatra.register` method (described below) is provided
for this task.

Requests are evaluated within a new `Sinatra::Base` instance -- routes,
before filters, views, helpers, and error pages all share this same context.
The default set of request-level helper methods (e.g, `erb`, `haml`, `halt`,
`content_type`, etc.) are simple instance methods defined on `Sinatra::Base`
or within modules that are included in `Sinatra::Base`. Providing new
functionality at the request level is achieved by adding instance methods to
`Sinatra::Base`.

As with DSL extensions, helper modules should not be added directly to
`Sinatra::Base` by extension authors with `include`; the
`Sinatra.helpers` method (described below) is provided for this task.

### `Sinatra::Application`

The `Sinatra::Application` class provides the default execution context
for _classic style applications_. It is a simple subclass of
`Sinatra::Base` that provides default option values and other behavior
tailored for top-level apps. When a classic style application is run,
all `Sinatra::Application` public class methods are exported to the
top-level.

Rules for Extensions
--------------------

 1. Never modify `Sinatra::Base` directly. You should not include or extend,
    change option values, or modify its behavior elsewise. Modular style
    applications will include your extension in their subclass explicitly
    using the `register` method.

 2. Never `require 'sinatra'` in your extension. You should only ever need
    to `require 'sinatra/base'`. The reason for this is that `require
    'sinatra'` is what triggers the classic style -- extensions should
    never trigger the classic style.

 3. Use the APIs described below where possible. You should not need to
    include or extend modules directly or define methods directly on a core
    Sinatra class. The specialized methods below handle all of that for you.

 4. Extensions _should_ be defined in separate modules under the `Sinatra`
    module. For example, an extension that added basic authentication
    primitives might be named `Sinatra::BasicAuth`.

Extending The Request Context with `Sinatra.helpers`
----------------------------------------------------

The most common type of extension is one that adds methods for use in
routes, views, and helper methods.

For example, suppose you wanted to write an extension that added an `h`
method that escaped reserved HTML characters (such as those found in other
popular Ruby web frameworks).

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra/base'

module Sinatra
  module HTMLEscapeHelper
    def h(text)
      Rack::Utils.escape_html(text)
    end
  end

  helpers HTMLEscapeHelper
end
{% endhighlight %}

The call to `Sinatra.helpers` includes the module in
`Sinatra::Application`, making all methods defined in the module
available to classic style applications. Using this extension in classic
style apps is as simple as requiring the extension and using the new
method:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/htmlescape'

get "/hello" do
  h "1 < 2"     # => "1 &lt; 2"
end
{% endhighlight %}

`Sinatra::Base` subclasses, on the other hand, must require _and_ include
the module explicitly using the `helpers` method:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra/htmlescape'

class HelloApp < Sinatra::Base
  helpers Sinatra::HTMLEscapeHelper

  get "/hello" do
    h "1 < 2"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Extending The DSL (class) Context with `Sinatra.register`
---------------------------------------------------------

Extensions can also extend Sinatra's class level DSL using the
`Sinatra.register` method. Here's an extension that adds a
`block_links_from` macro that checks the referer (sic) on each request for
a app provided pattern and sends back a `403 Forbidden` response when
a match is detected:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra/base'

module Sinatra
  module LinkBlocker
    def block_links_from(host)
      before {
        halt 403, "Go Away!" if request.referer.match(host)
      }
    end
  end

  register LinkBlocker
end
{% endhighlight %}

`Sinatra.register` adds all public methods in the module(s) given as class
methods on `Sinatra::Application`. It also handles exporting public methods to
the top-level when classic style apps are executed.

A classic style application would use this extension as follows:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/linkblocker'

block_links_from 'digg.com'

get '/' do
  "Hello World"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Modular style applications must register the extension explicitly in their
`Sinatra::Base` subclasses:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra/linkblocker'

class Hello < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::LinkBlocker

  block_links_from 'digg.com'

  get '/' do
    "Hello World"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Setting Options and Other Extension Setup
-----------------------------------------

Extensions can define options, routes, before filters, and error handlers by
defining a `registered` method on the extension module. The `Module.registered`
method is called immediately after the extension module is added to the
`Sinatra::Base` subclass and is passed the class that the module was
registered with.

The following example creates a very simple extension that adds basic
session auth support. Options are added for the username and password,
routes are defined for logging in, and helper methods are provided for
determining whether a user has been authorized:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra/base'

module Sinatra
  module SessionAuth

    module Helpers
      def authorized?
        session[:authorized]
      end

      def authorize!
        redirect '/login' unless authorized?
      end

      def logout!
        session[:authorized] = false
      end
    end

    def self.registered(app)
      app.helpers SessionAuth::Helpers

      app.set :username, 'frank'
      app.set :password, 'changeme'

      app.get '/login' do
        "<form method='POST' action='/login'>" +
        "<input type='text' name='user'>" +
        "<input type='text' name='pass'>" +
        "</form>"
      end

      app.post '/login' do
        if params[:user] == options.username && params[:pass] == options.password
          session[:authorized] = true
          redirect '/'
        else
          session[:authorized] = false
          redirect '/login'
        end
      end
    end
  end

  register SessionAuth
end
{% endhighlight %}

A classic application would use this extension by requiring the extension
library, overriding options, and using the helpers provided:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/sessionauth'

set :password, 'hoboken'

get '/public' do
  if authorized?
    "Hi. I know you."
  else
    "Hi. We haven't met. <a href='/login'>Login, please.</a>"
  end
end

get '/private' do
  authorize!
  'Thanks for logging in.'
end
{% endhighlight %}

A modular application is different only in that it must register the
extension module explicitly:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra/sessionauth'

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::SessionAuth

  set :password, 'hoboken'

  get '/public' do
    if authorized?
      "Hi. I know you."
    else
      "Hi. We haven't met. <a href='/login'>Login, please.</a>"
    end
  end

  get '/private' do
    authorize!
    'Thanks for logging in.'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Building and Packaging Extensions
---------------------------------

Sinatra extensions should be built as separate libraries and packaged as
gems or as single files that can be included within an application's `lib`
directory. The ideal process for using an extensions is installing a gem
and requiring a single file.

The following is an example file layout for a typical extension packaged as
a gem:

    sinatra-fu
    |-- README
    |-- LICENSE
    |-- Rakefile
    |-- lib
    |   `-- sinatra
    |       `-- fu.rb
    |-- test
    |   `-- spec_sinatra_fu.rb
    `-- sinatra-fu.gemspec
