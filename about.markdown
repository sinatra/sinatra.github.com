About
=====

Sinatra was designed and developed by __Blake Mizerany__ (bmizerany) in
California. Continued development would not be possible without the ongoing
financial support provided by [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and the emotional
support provided by [Adam Wiggins](http://adam.blog.heroku.com/) of Heroku,
[Chris Wanstrath](http://defunkt.github.com/), [PJ Hyett](http://pjhyett.github.com),
and the rest of the GitHub crew.

Sinatra would not be possible:

  letting Blake steal some of merbs internal code.

  years, caring about the README, and hanging in there when times were rough.
