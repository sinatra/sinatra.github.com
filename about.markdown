About
=====

Sinatra was designed and developed by __Blake Mizerany__ (bmizerany) in
California.  Continued development would not be possible without the ongoing
financial support provided by [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and the emotional
support provided by [Adam Wiggins](http://adam.blog.heroku.com/) of Heroku,
[Chris Wanstrath](http://defunkt.github.com/), [PJ Hyett](http://pjhyett.github.com),
and the rest of the GitHub crew.

Special thanks to the following extraordinary individuals, without whom
Sinatra would not be possible:

* [Ryan Tomayko](http://tomayko.com/about) (rtomayko) for constantly fixing
  whitespace errors __60d5006__
* [Ezra Zygmuntowicz](http://brainspl.at/) (ezmobius) for initial help and
  letting Blake steal some of merbs internal code.
* [Chris Schneider](http://gittr.com) (cschneid) for The Book, the blog,
  [irclogger.com](http://irclogger.com/sinatra), and a bunch of useful patches.
* [Markus Prinz](http://blog.nuclearsquid.com/) (cypher) for patches over the
  years, caring about the README, and hanging in there when times were rough.
* [Simon Rozet](http://atonie.org/) (sr) for a ton of doc patches, HAML options,
  and all that advocacy stuff he's going to do for 1.0.
* [Erik Kastner](http://metaatem.net/) (kastner) for fixing `MIME_TYPES` under
  Rack 0.5.

  Thin/Passenger.
* [Jon Crosby](http://joncrosby.me/) (jcrosby) for coffee breaks, doc fixes, and
  just because, man.
* [Karel Minarik](http://github.com/karmi) (karmi) for screaming until the
  website came back up.
* [Jeremy Evans](http://code.jeremyevans.net/) (jeremyevans) for unbreaking
  optional path params (twice!)
* [The GitHub guys](http://github.com/) for stealing Blake's table.
* [Nickolas Means](http://nmeans.org/) (nmeans) for Sass template support.
* [Victor Hugo Borja](http://github.com/vic) (vic) for splat'n routes specs and
  doco.
* [Avdi Grimm](http://avdi.org/) (avdi) for basic RSpec support.
* [Jack Danger Canty](http://6brand.com/) for a more accurate root directory
  and for making me watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueaHLHgskkw) just
  now.
* **Mathew Walker** for making escaped paths work with static files.
* **Millions of Us** for having the problem that led to Sinatra's conception.
* [Songbird](http://getsongbird.com/) for the problems that helped Sinatra's
  future become realized.
* [Rick Olson](http://techno-weenie.net/) (technoweenie) for the killer plug
  at RailsConf '08.
* **Steven Garcia** for the amazing custom artwork you see on 404's and 500's
* [Pat Nakajima](http://patnakajima.com/) (nakajima) for fixing non-nested
  params in nested params Hash's.

And last but not least:

* **Frank Sinatra** (chairman of the board) for having so much class he
  deserves a web-framework named after him.
